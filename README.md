Implement and explain algorithms that use randomization for solving problems.

(a)I Approach DSA in easy manner like i understand the problem then identify what are the input and output requirement.
clearly understand what the function or algorithm that can be needed in problem and what should be its output.
Design a proper flowchart which show the approchment process.
I faces many error problem in my first go so dont get discoureged about that its normal.
(b) I faces  difficulty to manage the logic what should be added to this problem and algorithms design ,
faces problem to analzes the Time and Space complexityand maintaining the quality of the code and how we connect DSA problem with real time problems.
(c)Hey ! This is Antima mishra here i persuing btech cse where i love to learn new concepts and i like to design the frontent web design where i make my first project called "SPOTIFY CLONE" .
I also exicted to join how to approch real life problem can be coverted into coding life . i do also participate in Smart India Hackathon where my project is selected in niversity level.
